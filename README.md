To create a website with a search box that connects to the TMDB API and autocompletes TV and series titles, we will need the following files:

1. `package.json`: This file will contain the project metadata and the dependencies required for the project.

2. `server.js`: This file will be the entry point of our application. It will set up the server and handle the API requests.

3. `App.js`: This file will contain the main React component of our application.

4. `SearchBox.js`: This file will contain the SearchBox component that will handle the search functionality.

5. `.env`: This file will contain the environment variables such as the TMDB API key.

Let's start with the `package.json` file:
